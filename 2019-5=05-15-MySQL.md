## MySQL
* The MySQL website is the major resource: http://www.mysql.com/  
* tutorial available : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/tutorial.html  
* The tutorial is part of the MySQL manual, which for version 5.7 is: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/

## codeanywhere
* codeanywhere website can be an alternative way to practice sql without download MySQL
    new connection > container > search sql > select php >create
    right click on mysql > SSH terminal > type 'mysql -uroot' (means that will use mysql)

## what is MySQL? 
* It is a relational database management system
    * A database is a structured collection of data
    * A database management system is used to add, access and process data in a database
    * A relational database stores data in tables
* It uses SQL, Structured Query Language, to access data in a database
* It is Open Source: download and modify the software
    * restrictions on use of the Open Source software
    * commercial version is available
    * MySQL is owned by Sun which in turn is a subsidiary of Oracle
* Contributed software is available
* Commonly used in web application in conjunction with PHP
* Written in C and C++
* Works on many platforms, including Windows and Linux
* Scalable, used on large databases: 60,000 tables, 5,000 million rows

## Relational databases
* A database consists of one or more tables
* Each table is organized into rows and columns
* Each row of a table is a record 
* Records may contain several pieces of information:  
  each column in a table corresponds to one of those pieces
* Relational databases strengths are:  
  information need only be stored one time.
  Data can retrieved by joining information from different table
 
## usage in practice
* Suppose you have a problem with customer orders: some goods have not arrived
* You wish to contact all customers who have ordered the item
* Your customer database contains two tables:
  A table of customer details giving contact information, indexed by a customer ID
  A table of orders, which includes the customer ID as one column
* If the item orderd is given in the orders table, you need both talbes  
  to prepare the information to email all customers who have ordered that item
* It would be inefficient and cause errors if the customer addressed were stored __with__ the orders

## Client/Server Architecture
* You use two programs when using __MySQL__:
    * The database server which is on the machine where the data is stored.
    * Client programs which connect to the database server to modify and retrieve data
* The server __controls__ concurrency: two users cannot modify the same record at the same time
* You don't have to be logged into the machine where the database is located
* Secure access to the database is controlled by passwords and permissions
* Besides mysql which allows access to databases, there are programs mysqldump for backup,  
  mysqlimport and mysqladmin
  
  
## Tutorial
* Need access to MySQL server on some machine
* Need the MySQL Client running on a machine you can log on to
* If you are going to create a database and its tables 
  you need permission to do so - it will be created on the server
* If you are the MySQL administrator, you are able to do that using a CREATE DATABASE command
* Otherwise permission is granted by the MySQL administrator using a GRANT command
* Assume that the database has already been created
* Open the Windows Powershell window.  
  shift + right-click on the folder > selecting Open PowerShell window here
* In some case, the path to MySQL binaries has not been set
* To make sure, issue this code --> $env:PATH += "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE;"
  This adds the paths to the MySQL binaries to the current path
  If the path has not be set the command, then will need to issued everytime you open a Powershell window
